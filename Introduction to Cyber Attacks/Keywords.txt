Worm Program
{Code:
   Worm:
   {find-host(h);
   rcopy(worm,h)
   rexec(worm,h)}
}


Trojan Horse
TrapDoor

invisible Trojan Horses       through dirty compilers

Security as Enabler

Adversaries:s
  -Hackers
  -Criminals
  -Hacktivists
  -Nation-state Actors(Military groups to promote warfare)


Vulnerability Types:
  -Finding Software Bug
  -Missing Security
  -Human
  -Bad Organization

Threat Types {CIA Model}
  -Leaking(Confidentially)
  -Integrity (Infect the system)<Asset> <Malicious tampering and corruption>
  -Availability (DDOS denial of service)
  -steal services 

Encryption
 End-to-end-encryption
 Link Encryption

Buffer Overflow(problems in memory) >> Integrity Attack

Denial Of service attack:
 Ampification
 Spoofing and Reflection


Indicators

Heuristic Attacks(dealth with complexity)
BruteForce(dealth wit size)


Cryptanylisis: (Wirte a python program to attack)
 Ciphertext only
 Known PlainText
 Create Codebook

Botnets:
Y2K , millenium bug,  1999
Just because we don't see something doesn't mean it's not there
zombie nets, botnets, Command and Control, amplification
fast flux networks

Botnet Arithmetic
1,Tcp - ip 3way handshake   throw lot of traffics
2,hidden ip                 sync flood

How many bots are required at 2 Mbps egress capacity for malware to take out a 10 Gbps network connection?  5000
IOT are not secure because of botnets
